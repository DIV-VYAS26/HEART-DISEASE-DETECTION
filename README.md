# ❤️ Detection of Heart Disease using Machine Learning

## Project Description

The project describes the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of heart disease based on the medical history of patients, including age, sex, type of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG, heart rate, and other factors. The project aims to illustrate a complete machine learning process, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model development, evaluation, and storage of the final model for making predictions on new data.

The dataset was preprocessed by addressing missing or erroneous data, transforming categorical variables to numerical variables, and scaling the numerical variables for better model performance. Exploratory Data Analysis was carried out to identify patterns, correlations, and risk factors for heart disease.

Various classification models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM were developed and evaluated using accuracy and F1-score. Logistic Regression performed best and was stored along with the scaler and feature columns in .pkl files for making predictions on new patient data without requiring model redevelopment.

The project illustrates the application of machine learning algorithms for the early prediction of heart disease and can be used as a starting point for real-world applications in the healthcare domain.

## Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Joblib.
